# Domestic Proof â€” 2025-10-24

## Summary
- Attempted to produce a domestic test print for `output/Menu_Gereni_print.pdf`.
- Physical printing could not be executed within the current CI/container environment.
- Performed digital verification steps available: confirmed file presence and size (`36 MB`) as of 2025-10-24 22:09 UTC.
- Unable to evaluate bleed, margins, and color fidelity without physical output or visual preview tools.

## Follow-up Recommendations
- Conduct physical print on matte 11"x17" stock with 0.125" bleed at first available workstation.
- Capture photos or scans of the print focusing on trim marks and color bars for archival evidence.
- Upload captured evidence to `workflow/proofs/` or linked asset repository once available.
